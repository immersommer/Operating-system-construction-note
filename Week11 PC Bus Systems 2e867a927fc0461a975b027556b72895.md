# ****PCI(Peripheral Component Interconnect) Bus****

## Typical architecture of the first PCI systems:

- The North Bridge decouples host bus (CPU specific, high speed and used by CPU internally) and PCI bus. Thus, PCI units and CPU can work in parallel.
- The PCI connection between North and South Bridge was later replaced by something faster.
- Bridges help integrating ISA (legacy bus system) and PCI transparently in one system.

## ****PCI – Basic****

- CPU-type independent, can be used for any type of cpu
- 32/64 bit, multiplexed address/data bus, i.e.,  address and data over the same bus
- But only has 4 4 interrupt lines (INTA-D)
    - **problem**: devices must  share interrupt line. Later replace by message signaled interrupt, which allow multiple virtual interrupt
- Scalable due to bridges and multi-function units ⇒ form a tree hierarchy
- Multi-Master capabilities (better than classic DMA)
    - any device attached to the bus can  take over the roll of the bus master to achieve the more efficient data transfers
- Mechanism to detect and auto-configure devices (resource allocation)
    - automatically detect and configure the device so that it have proper IO port and memory address space and interrupt so that the driver can interact with it.

## ****Interacting with PCI Devices****

- device driver use mem address space, IO address space to interact with device.
- Before the device driver can use these 2 interaction mechanisms, PCI BIOS has to allocate the address space range, IO port, and other resource (interrupt line) for the device by consulting the device configuration address space

## ****The PCI Configuration Space****

- On the PC, the configuration space is accessed indirectly via I/O ports
    - 2 I/O Ports : one for data read write, one for address the specific PCI configuration space, 32bit wide (first use the io port for address to find a pci configuration space, then use the other one to do read write)
- The bus + unit + function (16 bit) used in the io port for address define which PCI address space to access
    - bus (8 bit) is the number of the bus that directly connects to the device from upstream
    - unit /device (5 bit) : a serial number belonging to the enumeration of all the devices that are immediately reachable through the bus
    - function (3 bit) is a serial number belonging to the enumeration of all the functions housed by a device
- Register: define which register within that device configuration space do i want to access
- Each PCI address space has 256 bytes
    - First 64 bit contain the header
    - The rest 192 byte contain device specific data

- ****64-byte header format****

    - **Vendor and Device ID uniquely identify a device**.
    - Header bit 7=1 indicates a multifunction device
    - The device can be activated and deactivated via the Command register.
    - Each PCI configuration space can have up to six Base Address Registers (BARs),
        - which can be used during the PCI initialization phase to set up MMIO range and PIO for the device
        - which also publicize the MMIO (or PIO) addresses to be used when the OS wishes to interact with the device—the locations where device registers are found
    - **I**NT PIN/ INT LINE : define  which interrupt this device is allowed to use

## ****PCI Initialization****

Device driver is also identified by the vendor and device ID.  During system initialization, OS find a proper device driver for a device using it’s vendor and device ID. By consulting the PCI configuration space, OS knows the MMIO (or PIO) address range, INT line used by the device. Then OS use those information to instantiate the driver. But before this could happens, PCI has to be initialized.

1. Scan the bus hierarchy to determine the Bus number for each bus and Bridge number (primary, secondary, and subordinate) for each bridge.
    1. Recursively, buses that are descendants of some bus B are numerically larger than B, and buses that are ancestors of B are numerically smaller
    2. The bus enumeration allows every PCIe bridge G to be associated
    with three buses: primary, secondary, and subordinate.
    3. The primary and secondary are, respectively, the upstream and downstream buses that G connects. G’s subordinate is its numerically largest descendant bus.
2. Assign addresses (MMIO and PIO) for each device
    1. Align the current I/O and memory addresses
    2. For each device on the current bus
        1. Reserve I/O and memory addresses by read and write the base address registers
        2. Update the global I/O and memory pointers
        3. Initialize and activate the device
    3. Go back to the upstream hierarchy and update all the bridges in upstream direction to know which IO and memory are blow them
        
        For example we have 2 bridge A and B, below A there  are 1 device with MMIO range 1-4 MiB, below B there is one device with MMIO range 15 -20 MiB. So the MMIO rang for bridge A must be configured to 0-10, and for B 15-30. Such that, the memory request come from the root bridge (North bridge) can be send to proper device 
        
    4. Program and activate the bridge

## The PCI BIOS

- Configures PCI bridges and devices at boot time (PCI ****Initialization process****)
- After booting, the PCI BIOS allows
    - searching for PCI devices by device class or type
    - accessing the configuration space
- Access via
    - BIOS interrupt 0x1a (Real Mode)
    - the “BIOS32 Service Directory” (Protected Mode)
        - The BIOS32 Service Directory (in principle) allows to access arbitrary BIOS
        components.
        - It is located somewhere in the range 0xE0000–0xFFFFF:

## How PCI work in general?

1. PCI BIOS initialize the PCI bus system
    1. Scan the bus hierarchy to determine the Bus number for each bus and Bridge number (primary, secondary, and subordinate) for each bridge
    2. Allocate resource for each device by read and write their configuration space
    3. Activate the device by write the command field configuration space
2. During  OS initialization, OS find a proper device driver for a device using it’s vendor and device ID. By consulting the PCI configuration space (via BIOS32 Service Directory), OS knows the MMIO (or PIO) address range, INT line used by the device. Then OS use those information to instantiate the driver
3. In run time, software can communicate with device through MMIO and PIO, which are assigned to device in PCI BIOS initialization phase

# PCI Extensions and Successors

The important things is: although we have variant Bus system, they all have the PCI-like interface, so that the programmer don’t have to write drivers for different bus system. For example, they all use configuration space to do the device initialization (allocate the MMIO and PIO) for the device. By consulting the configuration space the software can know the MMIO range, PIO range, interrupt line the device use, etc,.  And they all use the tree hierarchy to manage the device and route the package.

1. What is ****AGP?****
    
    fast 1:1 connection of one (3D) graphics adapter, AGP adapter and bridge present themselves to the system like a PCI-to-PCI bridge and a normal PCI device
    
2. PCI-X (eXtended)
    
    PCI-bus extension,  Allows for higher bandwidth at full compatibility
    
3. PCI Express
    
    Bi-directional, serial, point-to-point connections
    
4. HyperTransport
    
    Standardized communication between North Bridge (integrated into CPU) and chipset that contains PCI bridge, as well as between the CPUS
    

For AGP, PCI-X,  PCI Express, HyperTransport, please look at the slides.
