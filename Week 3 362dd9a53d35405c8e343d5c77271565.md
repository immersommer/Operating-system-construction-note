## Interrupt

1. Why Interrupt?
    
    Operating system need the help of external device to do networking, store data ,etc. However, external devices are comparatively slower than CPU. So if there is no interrupt CPU would waste a lot of time waiting for external devices to match its speed with that of CPU (CPU is busy waiting for device processing the data).
    
2. Characteristic of interrupts
    1. Prioritization
        
        Problem :
        
        - Multiple interrupt requests can be signaled at once. Which one is more
        important?
        - While the CPU handles the most important request, further requests can
        be signaled.
        
        Solution:
        
        - in software: The CPU only has one IRQ (interrupt request) line and
        queries/services devices in a defined order
        - in hardware: A prioritization circuit assigns priorities to devices and only
        forwards the most urgent request for handling
        - with static priorities: each device statically gets assigned a priority
        - with dynamic priorities: priorities can be changed dynamically
    2. Lost Interrupts
        
        Problem:
        
        - During interrupt handling, and/or while interrupts are disabled, the
        CPU cannot handle new interrupts.
        - Memory for IRQs is (very!) limited,
            - when CPU handle the type A interrupt and type A interrupt occur again, the second one will lost because there are only 1 bit on memory per interrupt line
        
        Solution: in software
        
        - Interrupt handler routine should be as (temporally) short as possible
        - Interrupts should not be disabled longer than necessary by the CPU
        - A device driver should never assume that there is only one byte in the input buffer for a single interrupt. For a single interrupt driver should use a loop to get all the data from the input buffer.
    3. Interrupt Dispatch
        
        Problem:
        
        - Determine with little effort which device triggered the interrupt
            - Why not Sequential querying (CPU ask each device that share 1 interrupt line whether it trigger the interrupt)?
                - Time-consuming
                - unrelated devices involved
                - modifies state of I/O buses
        
        Solution: Interrupt vector
        
        - Assign a number to each interrupt index into vector
        - Each entry contains pointers to functions, which handle a specific interrupt
        - When an external event or exception is generated, the hardware will generate an interrupt flag. The CPU can based on the interrupt flag to get the interrupt vector number, queries the interrupt vector table (based on the address and interrupt vector number of the interrupt vector table) to obtain the address of the interrupt program for the corresponding interrupt number, and further executes the corresponding interrupt handler.
    4. Saving State
        
        Problem:
        
        - After running the handler routine, we want to return to interrupted context
        - Transparency: Interrupt handling supposed to happen unnoticed
        
        Solution:  State save
        
        - Hardware will save the essential state such as return address and status register, and the state will be restored by `IRET` instruction
        - Software will save registers for interrupted routine
    5. Nested Interrupt Handling
        
        Problem:
        
        - To react promptly to important events, interrupt handlers should be
        interruptible.  … but we should avoid unlimited nesting. (Why?)
            - stack may be overflow....
        
        Solution:
        
        - CPU only allows interrupts with higher priority
        - Current priority in status register, Previous priority on a stack
    6. Multiprocessor Systems
        
        Problem:
        
        - Each interrupt can only be handled by one CPU. But which one?
        - Additional interrupt category: Inter-processor interrupts (IPIs)
        
        Solution
        
        - More complex interrupt-handling hardware for multiprocessors. Potential algorithm:
            - static destination
            - random destination
            - programmable destination
            - destination depending on current CPU load
        
3. Hazards
    1. Spurious Interrupts
        - Interrupt-handling mechanism can be presented with spurious*(ghost ) interrupts, caused e.g. by Hardware errors Incorrectly programmed devices
            - A *spurious interrupt* is a hardware interrupt for which no source can be found. The term "phantom interrupt" or "ghost interrupt" may also used to describe this phenomenon. Spurious interrupts tend to be a problem with a **[wired-OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired-OR)** interrupt circuit attached to a level-sensitive processor input. Such interrupts may be difficult to identify when a system misbehaves.
        - Solution: Programming the operating system to predict Spurious Interrupts
    2.  Interrupt Storms
        - High interrupt frequency can overload or “freeze” a computer
        - Cause: Spurious interrupts, or too high I/O load,
        - Solution : Detect interrupt storms or Deactivate culprit device
        - Example: thrashing: if the page fault and swapping happens very frequently at a higher rate, then the operating system has to spend more time swapping these pages. This state in the operating system is termed thrashing
            - During thrashing, the CPU spends less time on some actual productive work spend more time swapping.
    
    4. Hardware-Architecture Examples
    
    1. Interrupts in the MC68000
        - 6 priority levels for hardware interrupts + NMI
            - Interrupt level 1–6, NMI level 7
            - Masking possible via status register
        - Only interrupts with higher priority and NMI can interrupt running interrupt handler
            - Status register is adapted automatically, i.e., when we handle the interrupt 2, status register will keep the number 2,  which means only interrupts that have higher priority (3-7) can interrupt the running interrupt handler for interrupt 2
        - Automatic state save on supervisor stack →nested handling possible
        - Vector number generation
            - autovectored: Index = Priority + 24
                - External circuitry notify the CPU  via  **VPA por**t that it should calculate the vector number automatically (Index = 24 + IPL0-2)
                    - Only 6 vectors available. With more devices, sharing is unavoidable.
            - non-autovectored (by external hardware): Index = 64 … 255,
                - External circuitry notify the CPU that it should read the vector number from the data bus.
        - No multiprocessor support
    2. Interrupts in x86 CPUs
        - Up and including i486, x86 CPUs had only 1 IRQ(Interrupt request) line and 1 NMI(non maskable interrupt) line
        - External hardware: prioritization, vector number generation by a chip named PIC 8259A:
            - 8 interrupt lines
            - 15 lines when cascading 2 PICs
            - no multiprocessor support
        - Today’s x86 processors contain the much more capable
        ”Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller” (APIC)
            - necessary for multiprocessor systems
            - completely superseded classic PIC 8259A
    3. APIC Architecture
        - APIC interrupt system: Local APIC on each CPU, and I/O APIC for external device connection
            
            ![Untitled](Week%203%20362dd9a53d35405c8e343d5c77271565/Untitled.png)
            
        - I/O APIC:
            - Typically integrated in PC chipset’s Southbridge
            - Usually 24 interrupt lines with round-robin prioritization
            - Has a Interrupt Redirection Table:
                - 64-bit entry for each interrupt line
                    - Describes interrupt signal
                    - Used for generating APIC bus message
                    - Decide how to forward the external interrupt to CPUs
                    
                    ![Untitled](Week%203%20362dd9a53d35405c8e343d5c77271565/Untitled%201.png)
                    
        - Local APICs
            - Receive IRQs through APIC bus
            - Also select/prioritize
            - Can directly handle two local interrupts (lint0/lint1)
            - Contain further functionality
                - Built-in timer, performance counters, thermal sensor
                - Command register:
                    - Send own APIC messages
                    - especially Inter-Processor Interrupt (IPI)
            - Programmable via 32-bit registers
        - APIC Architecture – Summary
            - Flexible IRQ distribution to CPUs in x86 Multi Processor system:
                - fixed(forward certain interrupt to fixed CPU), groups(forward certain interrupt to a group of CPUs), lowest task priority(forward a interrupt to  CPU with the lowest task priority)
                - multiple IRQs at once: prioritization with vector number
            - Vector numbers 16–254 can be freely assigned
                - should be enough to avoid sharing
            - Local APIC expects explicit EOI (end of interrupt request from OS)
                - Software should notify the APIC that the interrupt handling is done explicitly
            - With APIC, x86 in principle also supports priority levels
    4. IRQ Sharing
        - In practice, 24 IRQ lines in IOPIC proved to be insufficient
            - So some of the IRQ lines has to be shared between devices
        - Message-Signalled Interrupts (MSIs) finally resolved this.
